In preparation for the upcoming [Decentralized Umoja Bounty Hack](https://reachsh.typeform.com/to/vONsPBsy), I am practicing [REACH](https://docs.reach.sh) using their tutorials - [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://docs.reach.sh/tut/rps/#tut).

This is my first [dApp](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/dapps/reach/) project, and I know it is going to be a fun ride henceforth.

I would keep updating this repo each day (commitment), till I get full understanding of how Dapp works.
